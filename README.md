# Analysing Death difference of Right Handers and Left HandersAnalysing Death difference of Right Handers and Left Handers
• Utilized Python libraries such as pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyse National Geographic and CDC datasets, exploring age-specific 
left-handedness rates and their impact on average age at death.
• Produced visualizations using Matplotlib, and applied Bayes' theorem to calculate conditional probabilities, successfully refuting the claim 
that left-handed individuals die earlier on average• Utilized Python libraries such as pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyse National Geographic and CDC datasets, exploring age-specific left-handedness rates and their impact on average age at death. • Produced visualizations using Matplotlib, and applied Bayes' theorem to calculate conditional probabilities, successfully refuting the claim that left-handed individuals die earlier on average
