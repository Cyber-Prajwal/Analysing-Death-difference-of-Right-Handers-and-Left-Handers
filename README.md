## Here is a step by step breakdown:
- #### Step 1: Defining the Research Question
  **Objective:** Investigate whether left-handed individuals live shorter lives compared to right-handed individuals.<br>
  **Myth:** There is a common belief that left-handed people have shorter lifespans than right-handed people.<br><br>
- #### Step 2: Data Collection
  **Sources:** Data from credible sources, including National Geographic surveys and the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).<br><br>
  National Geographic: Provided population data, including age and handedness.<br>
  CDC: Supplied mortality data with potential breakdowns by age and other demographic factors.<br><br>
- #### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
  **Tools Used:** Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
      Pandas: Used for data manipulation, including cleaning, filtering, and merging datasets.<br>
       NumPy: Assisted in handling numerical operations and arrays.<br><br>
  **Tasks:**

    Cleaned and standardized datasets from both sources to ensure consistency.<br.
    Removed missing or incorrect data entries to avoid biased analysis.
    Merged and aligned datasets to ensure each individual's handedness and lifespan were correctly mapped.<br><br>
- #### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  **Objective:** Understand the distribution and characteristics of the data before performing complex analyses.<br><br>
  **Tools Used:**
    Matplotlib and Seaborn: Visualized the distribution of left-handed vs. right-handed individuals by age group.<br><br>
  **Key Insights:**
    Plotted the distribution of handedness across various age groups.<br>
    Identified trends and patterns in the dataset (e.g., any observable correlation between age and handedness).<br><br>
- #### Step 5: Statistical Analysis
  **Objective:** Determine if there was any significant difference in lifespans based on handedness.<br><br>

  **Tools Used:**

    Bayesian statistics: Applied to model the likelihood of differences in lifespan between left-handed and right-handed individuals.<br
  Methods:

    Performed hypothesis testing to statistically evaluate the claim.<br>
    Assessed the significance of observed differences in lifespan using confidence intervals and Bayesian inference.<br><br>
- #### Step 6: Data Visualization
  **Objective:** Create visual representations to effectively communicate results.<br><br>

  **Tools Used:**

    Matplotlib: Generated charts and graphs, including histograms and box plots, to visually compare lifespan distributions for left-handed and right-handed individuals.<br
  Visualizations:

    Comparison of average lifespan for left-handed vs. right-handed individuals.<br>
    Age-specific survival curves to represent the proportion of left-handers and right-handers alive at different ages.<br><br>
- #### Step 7: Drawing Insights
    **Key Finding:** No significant evidence was found to support the myth that left-handed individuals have shorter lifespans than right-handed individuals.<br>
                 The statistical analysis debunked the myth by demonstrating that the difference in lifespan between the two groups was not significant.<br><br>
- #### Step 8: Providing Actionable Insights
  **Insight:** This myth likely originated from early 20th-century biases, where left-handedness was discouraged, possibly affecting earlier data. Modern data shows no substantial evidence for               shorter lifespans due to handedness.<br><br>
  **Impact:** The research encourages a shift in the narrative around left-handedness, using data to challenge misconceptions.<br><br>

- **Methods:**
  Combined data visualizations with statistical reasoning in a report or presentation format.<br>
  Focused on storytelling with data to make the findings engaging and easy to understand for the audience.
